<h1>memory barriers</h1>

<p>ACQUIRE operations:  
It guarantees that all memory operations after the ACQUIRE operation will appear to happen after the ACQUIRE
operation with respect to the other components of the system.
ACQUIRE operations include LOCK operations and both smp_load_acquire() and smp_cond_acquire() operations. 
The later builds the necessary ACQUIRE semantics from relying on a control dependency and smp_rmb().</p>


<p>RELEASE operations:

It guarantees that all memory operations before the RELEASE operation will appear to 
happen before the RELEASE operation with respect to the other components of thesystem.
RELEASE operations include UNLOCK operations and smp_store_release() operations. 
Memory operations that occur after a RELEASE operation may appear to happen before it completes.</p>
